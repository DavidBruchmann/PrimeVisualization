This repo has different approachs while the first one was the motivating one to
create this repo.  

 - handle unpredictable long streams and chains of those streams in OOP.  
 - different types of repositories:  
   -- pages by configuration  
   -- pages by modules which can be installed like extensions  
   -- static pages where header, navigation etc. are still dynamic  
   -- pages with mentioned type of streams but optional still including further  
      content like headine and description  
 - displaying numbers and primes in different kinds, primary based on modules
   but with some supporting basic-methods.  
 - OOP framework with claim being useful for learning.
